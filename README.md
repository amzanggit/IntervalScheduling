# IntervalScheduling
CS430 Group Project

<h1>Project Title</h1>
<h2>Interval Assigning with Greedy Algorithm -- CS430 Project</h2>


<h2>Motivation</h2>
For this project, we are given the task to return the schedule of compatibles jobs that m machines can be assigned to complete. Our goal is trying to achieve the maximum productivity and sufficiency by getting as many jobs assigned to machines as possible. 


<h2>Code Style</h2>
We implement the algorithm in <Strong>Java</Strong> coding. We choose <Strong>TreeSet</Strong> as the data structure storing job intervals. 

<h2>How to use?</h2>
We implement a <Strong>readFile</Strong> method in our code so the code can read any <Strong>TXT file</Strong> with the total number of machines and each job's start and finish time. The code generates the final schedule automatically and return the TreeSet of job intervals with assignmed machines.
